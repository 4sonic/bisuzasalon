# Encabezado

Learn from fucking criticism. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere.
